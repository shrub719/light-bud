# Light Bud: Extension

## Documentation

The extension is a React app written in TypeScript transpiled with [WXT](https://wxt.dev/).

### Setup

1. In the `extension` directory, run:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
1. To start a dev session and open up a browser with the extension added, run:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
The extension should hot reload any changes saved, so you don't need to restart every time.
